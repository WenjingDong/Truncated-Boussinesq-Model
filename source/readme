bouss3m_v4.m solves the Galerkin truncated three-dimensional rotating Boussinesq model for constant buoyancy frequency. 
The barotropic, first baroclinic, and second baroclinic modes are kept.
The equations are diffused by hyperviscosity on velocity field.
Time stepping method is AB3.
bouss3m_v4.m is the main solver. 
k2g_: transforms a field from spectral space to physical space.
g2k_: transforms a field from physical space to spectral space.
