This repository contains the truncated stratified Boussinesq model written in MATLAB. The code was used to confuct experiments in the JFM paper [Mean flows induced by inertiaâ€“gravity waves in a vertically confined domain](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/abs/mean-flows-induced-by-inertiagravity-waves-in-a-vertically-confined-domain/FDD0690ACF10BEC910357EB9294FFCAE
